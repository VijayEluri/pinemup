    - many possibilities to customize the note-design
    - (nearly) unlimited user-defined categories
    - fast switch between categories (e.g. "home" and "office")
    - automatically save notes to file
    - open file format (xml)
    - FTP upload- and download functions
    - Export notes to a text-file



2. System requirements
------------------------
