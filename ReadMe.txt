1. About
------------------------
  pin 'em up is a tool for placing small notes/post-its (e.g. TODOs/reminders)
  on your desktop and organizing them in various ways (categorize, hide, upload, 
  export, etc.). Due to platform independence, the notes can also be shared
  on different operating systems.

  Features:
    - OS-independence
    - Integrates into system-tray
    - freely placeable notes
    - many possibilities to customize the note-design
    - (nearly) unlimited user-defined categories
    - fast switch between categories (e.g. "home" and "office")
        - via right-click menu
        - via keyboard-shortcuts (ctrl+1, ctrl+2, ..., ctrl+9, crtl+0)
    - automatically save notes to file
    - open file format (XML)
    - server upload- and download functions (FTP, WebDAV)
    - exporting notes into a text-file (e.g. for printing)



2. System requirements
------------------------
  pin 'em up only runs with Java 6 (JRE) or higher
  
  (get the latest version at http://java.sun.com)
