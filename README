1. About
------------------------
  pin 'em up enables you to place small notes on your desktop
  and assign them to five user-defined categories. Due
  platform-independence, those notes are available on different
  systems using either a shared partition or the integrated 
  FTP-functions.

  Features:
    - OS-independence
    - Integrates into system-tray
    - free placeable notes
    - five user-defined categories
    - fast switch between categories (e.g. "home" and "office")
    - automatically save notes to file
    - FTP-upload- and download functions
    - Export notes to a text-file
